# Comp-Sci 303 - Assignment 1

This is a simple program that creates a singly linked list that mimics the functionality of the standard template library linked list.

The function declarations can be found in the my-singly-linked-list.h Header file.

The function definitions can be found in the my-singly-linked-list.cpp file

In order to run the code you can use a compiler of your choice to compile the code in the main.cpp file and run it with the example input given below.
Your build may finish with some warnings. I am still looking into the warning messages but the code runs just fine with the current example input.
